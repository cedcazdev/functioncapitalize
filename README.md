# functioncapitalize

We want you to write a function called capitalize that takes 2 parameters, the first name and the last name: 
- first_name 
- last_name

Now you have to write the code inside the function.
You have to take the first letter of first_name and change it to uppercase.
Do the same with the first letter of last_name
Finally, you must return (return is used) the concatenation of first_name and last_name with the first letter of each one capitalised!
